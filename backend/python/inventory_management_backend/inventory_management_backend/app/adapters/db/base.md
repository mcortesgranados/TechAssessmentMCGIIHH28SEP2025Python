# 🛠️ SQLAlchemy ORM Base & Product Entity  
## Hexagonal Event-Driven Microservices Foundation

This module serves as the persistence layer foundation for a hexagonal (ports & adapters) microservice architecture, implementing SQLAlchemy ORM patterns with event-driven capabilities and strict adherence to SOLID principles for maintainable enterprise applications.

---

## ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

### 🏗️ Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- Acts as a driven adapter (secondary/infrastructure layer)
- Implements the persistence port for the Product domain entity
- Provides database abstraction that isolates business logic from ORM details
- Enables substitutability with different persistence implementations (SQL, NoSQL, etc.)
- Maintains clean boundaries between domain and infrastructure concerns

### 🔧 Microservices Pattern
- Encapsulates Product entity within inventory bounded context
- Supports database-per-service pattern for data autonomy
- Enables independent schema evolution and deployment
- Facilitates horizontal scaling of product data operations
- Provides clear service boundaries through entity encapsulation

### 📡 Event-Driven Architecture
- Supports domain event publishing through SQLAlchemy event listeners
- Enables Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time event streaming
- Facilitates eventual consistency across distributed services
- Provides audit trail capabilities through timestamp tracking
- Supports event sourcing patterns for state reconstruction

## SOLID PRINCIPLES ADHERENCE

**S - Single Responsibility Principle**  
✅ Base class solely manages declarative ORM configuration  
✅ Product entity focuses exclusively on product data representation  
✅ Clear separation between entity definition and business logic

**O - Open/Closed Principle**  
✅ Open for extension: new entities inherit from Base without modification  
✅ Closed for modification: existing entity structure remains stable  
✅ Supports mixins and traits for cross-cutting concerns

**L - Liskov Substitution Principle**  
✅ All entities derived from Base maintain consistent ORM behavior  
✅ SQLAlchemy abstractions ensure substitutability across implementations  
✅ Maintains behavioral contracts for persistence operations

**I - Interface Segregation Principle**  
✅ Entity exposes only necessary attributes for product representation  
✅ Avoids coupling to unused ORM features or methods  
✅ Clean separation of persistence concerns from business operations

**D - Dependency Inversion Principle**  
✅ Depends on SQLAlchemy abstractions, not concrete database implementations  
✅ Enables dependency injection of different database engines  
✅ Supports testing with in-memory databases or mocks

## ENTERPRISE PATTERNS IMPLEMENTATION

### 🔄 Active Record Pattern Enhancement
- Timestamp tracking for audit trails and event sourcing
- Automatic created_at/updated_at management
- Support for soft deletes and versioning strategies

### 🛠️ Repository Pattern Support
- Provides entity foundation for repository implementations
- Enables domain-driven design (DDD) aggregate patterns
- Supports specification pattern for complex queries

### 📊 Data Integrity & Validation
- Column constraints ensure data consistency
- Type safety through SQLAlchemy column definitions
- Nullable constraints enforce business rules at schema level

### 🔐 Security & Compliance
- Audit trail support through timestamp columns
- Schema-level constraints for data validation
- Prepared statement protection against SQL injection

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

- ✅ Efficient column type selection (BigInteger for IDs, DECIMAL for precision)
- ✅ Indexed primary key for fast lookups
- ✅ Server-side default timestamps reduce application overhead
- ✅ Optimal column sizes to minimize storage footprint

## INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES

```python
# Event-driven integration example
from sqlalchemy import event

@event.listens_for(Product, 'after_insert')
def publish_product_created(mapper, connection, target):
    # Publish domain event for product creation
    publish_event('ProductCreated', target.id, target.__dict__)

# Repository pattern integration
class ProductRepository:
    def __init__(self, session):
        self.session = session
    
    def save(self, product: Product) -> Product:
        self.session.add(product)
        self.session.commit()
        return product
```

---

## USAGE EXAMPLES

```python
# Direct entity usage
product = Product(
    name="Laptop Dell XPS 13",
    description="High-performance ultrabook",
    price=Decimal('1299.99'),
    stock=50
)

# Event-driven pattern
product.publish_domain_events()  # Custom method for event publishing

# Microservice integration
inventory_service.add_product(product)
```
